create a CSV file with the list of all the folder names with the header of folderName and then 

Just update the source and destination location

**NOTE** please make sure that you run the PowerShell in the user mode and not the admin mode as admin don't have access to the Mapped drive like users



**Important** If the folder path or file path is too long then, they might be skipped.
